What doesn't greylag do that SIMR cares about?


- differential modification of residues, w/alternation

- cluster implementation

- cyclic "permutations" (for scoring accuracy)




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These features would be better than what we currently have
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- multiple deltas for a residue (e.g. M+42, M+14)

- isotope differential delta


- built-in database shuffling


- refinement step
  - differential mods


- motif-based (or position-based) differential deltas
  - pyrrolidone carboxyl acid deltas?


- neutral loss?



current sloccount comparison:
xtandem: cpp: 13058
  (add count for parallel tandem)
greylag: cpp: 595 py: 863
omssa: cpp: 7583 (plus an unknown, possibly large number from the NCBI toolkits [33 distinct headers])
		(the toolkits are 1000000 sloc, 65% cpp, 34% c)

valgrind it

add 'throw()' to cpu-critical functions?

double-check handling of FP arithmetic using epsilons (no ==, no strict <)
test spectrum synthesis

test semi-tryptic cleavage
