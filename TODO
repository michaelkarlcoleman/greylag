Carboxyamidomethyl Cystenyl
C5H8O2N2S1
Cysteine
C3H5ONS
delta
+C2H3ON (~57)
PROBLEM: This 'N' will usually be N14, even in an N15 sample.
partial solution: allow deltas to be specified w override regime
"+C2H3ON(AVG/MONO)"
better: "+C2H3ON!" meaning "always use the first regime for this delta"


disallow (or warn) on setting same label twice in same file?


What doesn't greylag do that SIMR cares about?


- differential modification of residues, w/alternation

- cyclic "permutations" (for scoring accuracy)

- need to support multiple parent mass isotopes (shifts by +1/-1? to support
bad Orbitrap calls???)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These features would be better than what we currently have
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- multiple deltas for a residue (e.g. M+42, M+14)

- isotope differential delta


- built-in database shuffling


- refinement step
  - differential mods


- motif-based (or position-based) differential deltas
  - pyrrolidone carboxyl acid deltas?


- neutral loss?
