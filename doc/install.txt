Greylag Installation Guide
==========================


Prerequisites
-------------

Building greylag requires Python_ version 2.5 or later, SWIG_ 1.3.31 or later,
and reasonably recent versions of g++ and libstdc++, and make.  Recent Linux
distributions will likely have sufficiently new versions, but you may have to
install some of them.  Under Ubuntu_ or Debian_ Linux, this should suffice::

    $ sudo apt-get install python{,-dev} swig g++ make

If you also want to run the test suite and build the documentation, add::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-{nose,profiler,docutils}
    $ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-{extra,recommended} texlive-lang-french

Greylag was developed and tested on GNU/Linux, but in principle it should work
(perhaps with minor modifications) under other flavors of Unix, Mac OS X, and
Cygwin_ on Windows.

Compiling
---------

For a standard compile, just use

::

    $ make

There are additional options you can try that might give a little extra
speed--see the Makefile for more details.

Next, run the test suite::

    $ make check

This will run a number of unit tests and several small searches.

Then

::

    $ make install

will install to ``/usr/local/lib/greylag``, or you can use

::

    $ make DEST=/my/favorite/directory install

to install it elsewhere.  Once it's installed, you can add this directory to
your ``$PATH``, or symlink the programs into an appropriate directory with a
command like

::

    $ cd /usr/local/bin
    $ ln -s ../lib/greylag/greylag-* .

(The programs must be able to find the module files: ``greylag.py`` and the
cgreylag shared library.  The easiest way to arrange this is to place them in
the same directory as the programs, which the above steps accomplish.)

If ``greylag-chase --help`` gives you a usage message rather than a Python
error, your installation is probably correct.

If you wish to install the documentation, which is a local copy of the
website_, use

::

    $ cd doc
    $ make install
      ...or...
    $ make DEST=/my/doc/directory install
