README for greylag

See the files in the 'doc' directory for information about installing and
using greylag.

See 'COPYING' for greylag's copyright license.

The 'test' directory contains the greylag test suite.

The 'SIMR' directory contains some "glue" scripts that we use to run greylag
searches on our cluster, which we schedule using SGE.  It's somewhat specific
to our setup, but might be a good place to start.
